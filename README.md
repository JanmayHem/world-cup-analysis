## Tools Used
The following tools were used to perform the analysis:

JavaScript for data scraping
Python for preprocessing the data
Power BI for dashboarding and visualization

## Data Sources
The data for the analysis was scraped from the following sources:

[ESPN Cricinfo](https://www.espncricinfo.com/)

## Data Scraping
The data was scraped using JavaScript and [Bright Data](https://brightdata.com/). The data scraped from ESPN Cricinfo includes:
